-- |Template Haskell utility code to replicate instance declarations
-- to cover large numbers of types.  I'm doing that rather than using
-- class contexts because most Distribution instances need to cover
-- multiple classes (such as Enum, Integral and Fractional) and that
-- can't be done easily because of overlap.
--
-- I experimented a bit with a convoluted type-level classification
-- scheme, but I think this is simpler and easier to understand.  It
-- makes the haddock docs more cluttered because of the combinatorial
-- explosion of instances, but overall I think it's just more sane than
-- anything else I've come up with yet.
